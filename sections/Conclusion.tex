Conclusion goes here. These were some of the most important aspects of the seminar paper. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to the seminar supervisors. 
Ideas:\\
Motion Capture especially markerless seems to be a highly use case depending topic. There is no single method that ticks all boxes.
This is especially the case when it to complex poses that are not present in the training dataset as most approaches fail there. 
So the training data should be as good as represented of the final deployment of the solution.}

The research field of motion capture is a complex topic with various large different approaches.
Depending on the intended use-case different input sensors and output formats are used. 
This makes approaches hard to compare to each other.
While benchmark datasets try to solve these problems the input and or output of approaches often need modifications, so a direct comparison still is not as easily possible.
All State-of-the-art approaches using data driven workflows, this means that getting good training data is nearly as important as the approach itself.
Often these datasets are not available to the public or only under certain license restrictions.
