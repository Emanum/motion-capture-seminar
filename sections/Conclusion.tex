\section{Conclusion}
In this seminar paper we tried to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art for motion capture.
The research field of motion capture is a complex topic with various large different approaches.
Depending on the intended use-case different input sensors and output formats are used. 
This makes approaches especially hard to compare to each other.
While benchmark datasets try to solve these problems the input and or output of approaches often need modifications, so a direct comparison is still not easily possible. 
All state-of-the-art approaches using data driven workflows, this means that getting good training data is nearly as important as the approach itself.
We formulated tasks for our task description and described a possible solution.
While we could not find an existing approach that fulfills these tasks completely we still have seen great improvement and impressive results in the last years.
