\section{Conclusion}

Largely different approaches to motion capture including various sensor data, different goals in mind and non standardized datasets makes the research field of motion capture a complex topic to get started with.
In this seminar paper an overview of the current state-of-the-art for motion capture was given by examining a broad spectrum of different approaches, categorizing and comparing them accordingly.
All state-of-the-art approaches using data driven workflows, this means that getting good training data is nearly as important as the algorithm and model itself.
The use-case of Vtuber live concerts was examined, specific goals and tasks extracted and possible solution was drafted.
An existing approach that fulfills all goals completely was not found. However, great improvement has been made by various researchers and people within the industry in the last years to achieve impressive results.
