\section{Discussion}
\label{chapter_discussion}

While you don't have to include a discussion section, it is encouraged that you try to add to existing knowledge in some way. This may be through comparison of existing methods, critical reflection, etc.


Modal based constraints: 


we fit a model-based skeleton to the 3D and 2D predictions in order
to satisfy kinematic constraints and reconcile the 2D and 3D predic-
tions across time -> XNect
